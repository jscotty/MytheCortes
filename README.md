# MytheCortes
Mythe project by Justin Bieshaar<br><br>

My first game for mobile devices.
We had decided fast as a team to make a RPG game of the myth Hernan Cortez with his travel to America for gold. 
I was the only programmer in our team. I started the project with a classmate. But he quit.<br><br>

This was my first big project. I learned to work with managers, responsivity for mobile, serialized save load 
data and game-feel. I loved to work on this project. It was my first full game with Unity3D C#.<br><br>

Please take a look at this code:<br><br>
